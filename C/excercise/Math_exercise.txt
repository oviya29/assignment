16. Lexicographical order:
From Wikipedia,
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) is a generalization of the way words are alphabetically ordered based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. This generalization consists primarily in defining a total order on the sequences (often called strings in computer science) of elements of a finite totally ordered set, often called an alphabet.

Print numbers from 1 to 25 in lexicographic order-
1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 2 20 21 22 23 24 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

23. Write a C program to find next smallest palindrome of a given number. Go to the editor
From Wikipedia,
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020. Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!".
Example 1:
Input: n = 121
Output: Next smallest palindrome of 121 is 131


24. Write a C program to calculate e raise to the power x using sum of first n terms of Taylor Series. Go to the editor
From Wikipedia,
In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point.
Example:
The Taylor series for any polynomial is the polynomial itself.
C programming Exercises: Math - Taylor Series
The above expansion holds because the derivative of ex with respect to x is also ex, and e0 equals 1.
This leaves the terms (x − 0)n in the numerator and n! in the denominator for each term in the infinite sum.
Example 1:
Input: n = 25
float x= 5.0
Output: e^x = 148.413162

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.
