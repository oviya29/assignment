#include<iostream>
class base
{
public:
virtual void print()
{
cout <<"Base funtion " << end 1;
}
};
class derived : public base
{
public:
void print ()
{
cout <<"Derived funtion " <<end1;
}
};
int main()
{
Derived derived 1;
Base *base 1= & derived 1;
base 1 print ();
return 0;
}

output
Derived fution
